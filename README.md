# EX_Refrigerator
A few notes about the exercise:
I had some questions that I asked several times and I was not answered
Therefore I made the following assumptions:
1. The name of an item is limited to 50 characters
2. An item's expiration date cannot be before 2010
3. There are items that are not in the fridge (therefore when you take an item out of the fridge it will not be deleted from the list of items!)
